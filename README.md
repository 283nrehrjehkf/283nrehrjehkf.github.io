It was originally fitted with a 3.2L inline-six engine based on the engine of the standard E46 M3. The car first entered the GT class of the American Le Mans Series in 2000, in which it only took a single victory and was beaten on several occasions by the Porsche 911 GT3-R. 

A newly developed P60B40 V8 engine was quickly placed into the race car before the beginning of the racing 2001 season. It was developed alongside the BMW V10 engine that was used to power Williams Formula 1 cars during the 2001 F1 season. The old engine was ditched as BMW's engineers couldn't squeeze any more horsepower out of it. 

The new engine gave the M3 GTR GT a competitive edge over the Porsche 911 GT3-R and allowed it to win seven out of the ten events in the GT category for the 2001 season. Porsche claimed during the 2001 ALMS season that BMW had violated the ALMS entry rules and the spirit of Gran Turismo through protesting the V8 engine in the M3 GTR GT was not available in any road legal BMW M3. 

It has a short gear ratio, giving it good acceleration to reach its top speed with ease, and also has a great handling, making it a great choice for twisty tracks.
